## Instructions for Peer Assessment 1

This repository contains the R markdown file (PA1_template.Rmd) required for this assessment and the markdown and html files processed by "knitr" (PA1_template.md and PA1_template.html). The "figure" folder contains the four plots included in the html file (unnamed-chunk-4.png, unnamed-chunk-7.png, unnamed-chunk-11.png and unnamed-chunk-15.png).
